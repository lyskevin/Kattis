# Kattis Programs

Solution code for Kattis problems that I've solved. The coding style may not be the best since I will be focusing on coming up with solutions that are fast enough to pass all of Kattis' test cases for any given problem.

I have decided to leave some comments in my source code from now on for future reference.
