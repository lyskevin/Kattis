# Kattis Programs

Solution code for Kattis problems that I've solved. The coding style may not be the best since I will be focusing on coming up with solutions that are fast enough to pass all of Kattis' test cases for any given problem. Maybe I'll hit 1000 Kattis points on day :)

I have decided to leave some comments in my source code from now on for future reference.
