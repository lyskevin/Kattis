## Personal Thoughts

Problem that I attempted while preparing to become a Teaching Assistant (TA) for NUS' CS2040 (Data Structures and Algorithms) course in Semester 1 of AY19/20. Self-explanatory problem. However, I did make the mistake of exiting the inner for loop after finding a candle, which resulted in a few Run Time Error verdicts. I realised that I should finish reading all the inputs for each test case regardless of whether a suitable candle is found since not doing so would result in input mismatch.
