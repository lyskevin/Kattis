## Personal Thoughts

Problem that I attempted during my winter break in 2019. I referred to this link https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/135368/how-to-figure-out-the-log-of-a-number-without-a-calculator to figure out how to find the logarithm of large numbers. I used a rough approximation of the process mentioned in that link (such as only using the first digit of the given number to find the mantissa and using the number's length (since it is given as a string) to approximate the value of its base 10 logarithm).
