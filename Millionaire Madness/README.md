## Personal Thoughts

Problem that I attempted while preparing to become a Teaching Assistant (TA) for NUS' CS2040 (Data Structures and Algorithms) course in Semester 1 of AY19/20. I modified Dijkstra's algorithm to solve the problem; I used the minimum ladder height needed to get to each position as the criteria for comparison instead of the minimum total distance.
