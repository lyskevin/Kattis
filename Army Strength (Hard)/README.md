## Personal Thoughts

Problem that I attempted during my winter break in 2019. Can be solved by comparing the maximum strength of the monsters in Godzilla's army with that of MechaGodzilla's. Godzilla wins if its army's maximum strength is >= that of MechaGodzilla's. MechaGodzilla wins in any other scenario. There is no scenario in which the outcome is uncertain.
