## Personal Thoughts

Problem that I attempted during my winter break in 2019. Can be solved by finding the largest dvd that is in the correct (ascending) order and subtracting that number from the total number of DVDs. For example, in one of the given test cases, the sequence of DVDs is 5 1 2 4 3. If 4 and 5 were to be removed, then we have the ascending sequence 1 2 3, so 3 is the largest dvd that is in the correct order. Hence, we need 5 - 3 = 2 moves to sort the DVDs in ascending order.
