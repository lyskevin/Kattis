## Personal Thoughts

Problem that I attempted while preparing to become a Teaching Assistant (TA) for NUS' CS2040 (Data Structures and Algorithms) course in Semester 1 of AY19/20. For each student, I sorted the integers representing different courses and then created a string using the sorted integers. In this way, each course combination will have a unique string that maps to it. I used a HashMap to map each course combination to its popularity and updated the popularity whenever necessary. After this it was just comparing popularity scores and counting the number of students who take the course combinations with the highest popularity.
