## Personal Thoughts

Problem that I attempted while I was a Teaching Assistant (TA) for NUS' CS2040 (Data Structures and Algorithms) course in Semester 1 of AY19/20. A greedy algorithm has to be used together with a priority queue. I initially incremented boxes one by one but this led to a TLE verdict. I then changed it to add boxes using the fractional  weight of each city's population, which gave an AC verdict. However, this solution takes > 1 second to run so I feel that it definitely can be optimised more.
