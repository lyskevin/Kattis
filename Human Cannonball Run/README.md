## Personal Thoughts

Problem that I attempted while preparing to become a Teaching Assistant (TA) for NUS' CS2040 (Data Structures and Algorithms) course in Semester 1 of AY19/20. I modelled it as a graph problem and used Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from the source to the destination.
