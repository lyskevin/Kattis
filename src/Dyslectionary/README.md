## Personal Thoughts

Problem that I attempted while preparing to become a Teaching Assistant (TA) for NUS' CS2040 (Data Structures and Algorithms) course in Semester 1 of AY19/20. I stored the words in an ArrayList and used the Collections.sort() method to sort the list with a custom comparator before printing the formatted output.
