## Personal Thoughts

Problem that I attempted while I was a Teaching Assistant (TA) for NUS' CS2040 (Data Structures and Algorithms) course in Semester 1 of AY19/20. Tricky problem but in the end I solved it by drawing some diagrams on paper and figuring out the amount of tape needed for the remaining amount of paper at each instance.
