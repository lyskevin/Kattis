## Personal Thoughts

Problem that I attempted while I was a Teaching Assistant (TA) for NUS' CS2040 (Data Structures and Algorithms) course in Semester 2 of AY19/20. Can be solved by generating a valid row (if possible) for the given value of n and rotating it by one position at each iteration to form a prime matrix.
