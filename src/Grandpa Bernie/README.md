## Personal Thoughts

Problem that I attempted while preparing to become a Teaching Assistant (TA) for NUS' CS2040 (Data Structures and Algorithms) course in Semester 1 of AY19/20. I used a HashMap to map each country to a unique integer, as well as an ArrayList of ArrayLists of Integers to keep track of the number of trips to each country. I then sorted the ArrayLists so that each query could be answered in O(1) time.
