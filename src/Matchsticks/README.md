## Personal Thoughts

Problem that I attempted during my winter break in 2019. Can be solved by first using dynamic programming to pre-compute the minimum and maximum  numbers which can be formed from any number of matchsticks in the range [2, 100]. Each subsequent query can then be answered in O(1) time.
