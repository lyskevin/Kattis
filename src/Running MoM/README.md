## Personal Thoughts

Problem that I attempted during AY20/21 Semester 1. Can be solved by modelling the cities and flight paths as a graph and checking for cycles using DFS. A data structure containing DFS predecessors (a HashSet in my case) can be used to differentiate between a normal visited city and one which is part of a cycle.
