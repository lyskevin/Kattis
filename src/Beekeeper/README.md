## Personal Thoughts

Problem that I attempted while I was a Teaching Assistant (TA) for NUS' CS2040 (Data Structures and Algorithms) course in Semester 2 of AY19/20. Can be solved by using iteration to count the number of vowel pairs in each word, and printing the word with the most number of vowel pairs. There seems to be at least one test case where the answer is a word with 0 vowel pairs (perhaps just a single word for that test case).
