## Personal Thoughts

Problem that I attempted while preparing to become a Teaching Assistant (TA) for NUS' CS2040 (Data Structures and Algorithms) course in Semester 1 of AY19/20. I used a custom linked list and manipulated head, tail and next pointers when necessary. I avoided doing any string concatenation until it was time to print the output.
