## Personal Thoughts

Problem that I attempted while preparing to become a Teaching Assistant (TA) for NUS' CS2040 (Data Structures and Algorithms) course in Semester 1 of AY19/20. I used Kruskal's algorithm and a union-find data structure with path compression (source code from Princeton University) to find the required roads. I only read in input above the main diagonal in order to cut down some of the I/O time since the 2D array is symmetric across the main diagonal.
