## Personal Thoughts

Problem that I attempted while I was a Teaching Assistant (TA) for NUS' CS2040 (Data Structures and Algorithms) course in Semester 2 of AY19/20. Can be solved by using Dijkstra's algorithm and keeping track of whether the flight ticket has been used when each vertex is polled from the priority queue.
