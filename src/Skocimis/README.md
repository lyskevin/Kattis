## Personal Thoughts

Problem that I attempted while I was a Teaching Assistant (TA) for NUS' CS2040 (Data Structures and Algorithms) course in Semester 2 of AY19/20. Can be solved by using a greedy algorithm to pick the kangaroo that hops into the middle of the other two, as well as its new position.
