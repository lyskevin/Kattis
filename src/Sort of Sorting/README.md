## Personal Thoughts

Problem that I attempted while preparing to become a Teaching Assistant (TA) for NUS' CS2040 (Data Structures and Algorithms) course in Semester 1 of AY19/20. I chose to use merge sort since it is a stable sort. I also submitted a solution involving a TreeSet and a custom comparator but the students probably would not have learnt about Binary Search Trees yet so the merge sort solution is more appropriate.
