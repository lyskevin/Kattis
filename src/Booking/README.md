## Personal Thoughts

Problem that I attempted while I was a Teaching Assistant (TA) for NUS' CS2040 (Data Structures and Algorithms) course in Semester 2 of AY19/20. Can be solved by sorting the the start and end times of each booking and using the merge routine/a priority queue to find the maximum overlap between a group of booking period, which is equal to the minimum number of rooms required.
