Problem that I attempted while preparing to become a Teaching Assistant (TA) for NUS' CS2040 (Data Structures and Algorithms) course in Semester 1 of AY19/20. I used a stack, queue and priority queue and compared the given operations to operations on each of the three data structures in order to determine the hidden data structure, if applicable.
