## Personal Thoughts

Problem that I attempted while I was a Teaching Assistant (TA) for NUS' CS2040 (Data Structures and Algorithms) course in Semester 1 of AY19/20. The segments can be sorted and paired in descending order until either color runs out. Each pairing uses up 2cm of rope: 1cm to join the different colors together and 1cm to join both ends of the combined rope segment to other rope segments or to itself if there are no rope segments left.
