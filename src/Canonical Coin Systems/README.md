## Personal Thoughts

Problem that I attempted during my winter break in 2019. We let limit = sum of two largest denominations. The problem can then be solved by running and comparing results from both the greedy and dynamic programming coin change algorithms for integers in the range [1, limit). The coin system is canonical if the results match over the entire range of integers.
