## Personal Thoughts

Problem that I attempted during my winter break in 2019. Can be solved by first sorting the stalagmites and stalactites, and then using a brute force algorithm to try all heights in the range [1, h]. For each height, binary search can be used to find the number of obstacles encountered.
