## Personal Thoughts

Problem that I attempted while preparing to become a Teaching Assistant (TA) for NUS' CS2040 (Data Structures and Algorithms) course in Semester 1 of AY19/20. I used an ArrayList to keep track of the egg's position after each move, as well as an index counter to keep track of the current position. Undoing would simply subtract from the index counter.
