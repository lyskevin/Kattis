## Personal Thoughts

Problem that I attempted while I was a Teaching Assistant (TA) for NUS' CS2040 (Data Structures and Algorithms) course in Semester 2 of AY19/20. Can be solved by calculating the sum of the weights of all subsets and subtracting the sum of the weights of all subsets with a weight lower than 200 (computed with recursive backtracking).
