## Personal Thoughts

Problem that I attempted while I was a Teaching Assistant (TA) for NUS' CS2040 (Data Structures and Algorithms) course in Semester 1 of AY19/20. I initially used an array to store the class distinctions and got a runtime error, which got fixed after I changed it to an ArrayList.
