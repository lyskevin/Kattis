## Personal Thoughts

Problem that I attempted while preparing to become a Teaching Assistant (TA) for NUS' CS2040 (Data Structures and Algorithms) course in Semester 1 of AY19/20. 2 stacks can be used to simulate the problem. There is only a need to move socks from the original pile to the auxiliary pile or compare the sock at the top of the original pile with that of the auxiliary pile. I also got a harsh reminder about Integer caching after getting many Wrong Answer (WA) verdicts due to my use of == instead of Integer.equals().
