## Personal Thoughts

Problem that I attempted while preparing to become a Teaching Assistant (TA) for NUS' CS2040 (Data Structures and Algorithms) course in Semester 1 of AY19/20. The problem is pretty self-explanatory. However, it was around this time that I found out that I/O operations are quite slow so I've started using the FastReader (custom class) and StringBuilder (found in the Java API) classes for input and output, respectively. I might forget to use them for some problems but I definitely will use them for problems with large enough I/O operations.
