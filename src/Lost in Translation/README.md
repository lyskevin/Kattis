## Personal Thoughts

Problem that I attempted while I was a Teaching Assistant (TA) for NUS' CS2040 (Data Structures and Algorithms) course in Semester 2 of AY19/20. Can be solved by using the Breadth First Search (BFS) algorithm to maintain the BFS spanning tree property. A modification can be made to store the minimum cost to translate the text to a given language from any other language. The answer is the sum of all such costs; i.e. the total weight of the BFS spanning tree. If th BFS spanning tree cannot be formed, then there is no solution because some languages will not be covered during translation.
