## Personal Thoughts

Problem that I attempted during the summer holidays of 2020. Can be solved by binary searching for the appropriate (minimum) weight to use. One observation is that a specified weight is valid if weights which are larger than it appear consecutively, provided we ignore smaller or equivalent weights
