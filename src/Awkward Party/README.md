## Personal Thoughts

Problem that I attempted while preparing to become a Teaching Assistant (TA) for NUS' CS2040 (Data Structures and Algorithms) course in Semester 1 of AY19/20. The crux of this problem is to find the minimum distance between two occurrences of the same number when given a row (array) of numbers. I used a HashMap to store the previously recorded index of each number and updated the minimum distance accordingly when iterating through the array.
