## Personal Thoughts

Problem that I attempted during the winter break of AY20/21. We are guaranteed to win once the number is a multiple of 3 just before the other player's turn, in which case we can just keep adding 3 after both player's turns regardless of the other player's response. Otherwise, we can add twice the difference between the other player's response and the original number. This is guaranteed to pass test groups 1 and 2, and is statistically certain to pass test group 3.
