## Personal Thoughts
Problem that I attempted during the summer holidays of 2020. Can be solved by greedily choosing directions.
Minimum time: Shortest distance from end of the pole by ant closest to the center of the pole.
Maximum time: Longest distance from end of the pole by ant furthest away from said end.
