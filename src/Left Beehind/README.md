## Personal Thoughts

Problem that I attempted while I was a Teaching Assistant (TA) for NUS' CS2040 (Data Structures and Algorithms) course in Semester 1 of AY19/20. Self-explanatory problem, except that I mistakenly used && in the while loop instead of || during my first two submissions. Forgot about De Morgan's laws for a while there.
