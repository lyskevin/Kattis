## Personal Thoughts

Problem that I attempted while preparing to become a Teaching Assistant (TA) for NUS' CS2040 (Data Structures and Algorithms) course in Semester 1 of AY19/20. I initially looked at the problem from the wrong perspective as I was thinking of assigning people to multiple queues (perhaps a PQ of queues) but that would drive up the time complexity significantly. Some advice was given to me to look at the problem in terms of workstations and their available unlock times. I ended up doing that and solving the problem with the help of a PQ and some custom comparators.
