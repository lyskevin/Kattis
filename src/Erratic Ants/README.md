## Personal Thoughts

I tried this problem while taking NUS' CS2040 (Data Structures and Algorithms) course. I used a BFS algorithm with path-reconstruction in order to solve the problem. This was probably one of my first attempts at coding the BFS algorithm, which is why the code has quite a few comments. I also represented one step in the North, South, East and West directions differently so that I could assign a unique integer to each location in the given grid.
