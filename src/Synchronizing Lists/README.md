## Personal Thoughts

Problem that I attempted while preparing to become a Teaching Assistant (TA) for NUS' CS2040 (Data Structures and Algorithms) course in Semester 1 of AY19/20. I used a HashMap to map integers in the first list to the corresponding integers in the second list after sorting both lists. I then used a copy of the (unsorted) first list to produce the desired ordering of integers from the second list.
