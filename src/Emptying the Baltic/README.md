## Personal Thoughts

Problem that I attempted while I was a Teaching Assistant (TA) for NUS' CS2040 (Data Structures and Algorithms) course in Semester 2 of AY19/20. Can be solved by using Dijkstra's algorithm and using the drain's location as the source node. The algorithm also has to keep track of the maximum elevation level seen along the path.
