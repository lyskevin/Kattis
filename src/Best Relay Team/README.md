## Personal Thoughts

Problem that I attempted while preparing to become a Teaching Assistant (TA) for NUS' CS2040 (Data Structures and Algorithms) course in Semester 1 of AY19/20. I used two arrays and a custom Runner class to sort runners by their first and subsequent lap run times. I then iterated through both arrays to find the best possible total time since the upper bound of the number of runners is pretty small.
