## Personal Thoughts

Problem that I attempted during the winter break of AY20/21. Use Prim's algorithm with the specified sources. I need to learn more Java optimisations since forEach with a Consumer is fast enough but normal for loops and enhanced for loops are not. Even then, forEach just barely passes the time limit.
