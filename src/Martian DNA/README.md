## Personal Thoughts

Problem that I attempted during the winter break of AY20/21. Use an array/HashMap to count the number of required bases and their frequencies, and a counter variable to keep track of the remaining number of bases which are not in the current substring (O(N) linear pass with O(1) time to evaluate the validity of the substring formed using the current index as the starting index).
