## Personal Thoughts
Problem that I attempted during the summer holidays of 2020. Can be solved by greedily picking addresses to deliver to (highest absolute distance away from 0 first) while trying to deliver letters along the way. I used a deque to access addresses on both ends (most negative and most positive).
