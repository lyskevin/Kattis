## Personal Thoughts

Problem that I attempted while preparing to become a Teaching Assistant (TA) for NUS' CS2040 (Data Structures and Algorithms) course in Semester 1 of AY19/20. The key mapping and checking for spaces (i.e. when two characters are on the same phone key) is a bit tedious but other than that the problem isn't too difficult.
