## Personal Thoughts

Problem that I attempted during my winter break in 2019. The number of digits of the factorials of the numbers in the range [0, 1000000] can all be precalculated by taking the incremental sum of logarithms (in base 10), which allows every subsequent query to be answered in O(1) time.
