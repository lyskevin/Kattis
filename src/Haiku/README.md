## Personal Thoughts

Problem that I attempted during AY20/21 Semester 1. Can be solved by using DP on the three given lines. Be careful of using split to get rid of the spaces within a line and combining the words back together as this could create invalid syllables in the input. For instance, if the original input is "i am" and the split method is used to get "iam", then the syllable "iam" could be considered when it was not present in the original input.
