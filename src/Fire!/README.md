## Personal Thoughts

Problem that I attempted while preparing to become a Teaching Assistant (TA) for NUS' CS2040 (Data Structures and Algorithms) course in Semester 1 of AY19/20. I used a multi-source BFS algorithm and enqueued all the vertices which are on fire before enqueueing Joe's position. This ensures that the fire always gets to move first and emulates the fact that Joe cannot escape using a given position if both the fire and him reach it at the same time. More if-else statements and hard coding than I would like but at least the code works.
