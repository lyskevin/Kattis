## Personal Thoughts

Problem that I attempted while I was a Teaching Assistant (TA) for NUS' CS2040 (Data Structures and Algorithms) course in Semester 2 of AY19/20. Can be solved by using iteration to find a pair of integers that satisfy the condition. Start from the largest integer that can be multiplied by v1 so that the first valid assignment uses the least number of bottles (i.e. is the desired solution).
