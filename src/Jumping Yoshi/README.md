## Personal Thoughts
Problem that I attempted during the summer holidays of 2020. Can be solved by using BFS. The main points to take note of are that there will be at most 1 million vertices and <b>edges</b> (so BFS is fast enough) and for two pebbles (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) of the form (index, spots), <b>2 * y2 == x1 + x2 + y1 + y2</b>.
