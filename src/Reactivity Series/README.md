## Personal Thoughts

I tried this problem while taking NUS' CS2040 (Data Structures and Algorithms) course. I did this while practising graph algorithm implementations, which is why I have both BFS and DFS solutions. The overarching solution involves the use of Kahn's algorithm to sort the nodes topologically.
