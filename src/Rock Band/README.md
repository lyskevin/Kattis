## Personal Thoughts

Problem that I attempted during my winter break in 2019. Can be solved by using 1D arrays to store the first input list and the maximum possible ranks (among all input lists) of every song. We can then iterate through first input list with the help of the ranks in the rank array to find the smallest subset of songs which fit the given criteria.
