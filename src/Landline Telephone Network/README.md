## Personal Thoughts

Problem that I attempted during AY20/21 Semester 1. Form an MST using only secure buildings, then form an extended MST which includes the insecure buildings. This ensures that insecure buildings form the leaf nodes of the resulting MST, and thus communications will not pass through them unless they form the endpoints.
