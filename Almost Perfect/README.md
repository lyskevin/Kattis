## Personal Thoughts

Problem that I attempted during my winter break in 2019. Can be solved by computing the sum of proper divisors for each n and subtracting n from it. The sum of all divisors of a number is the product of the sums of every prime factor's powers. I referred to this link https://www.math.upenn.edu/~deturck/m170/wk3/lecture/sumdiv.html to understand the formula.
