## Personal Thoughts

Problem that I attempted while preparing to become a Teaching Assistant (TA) for NUS' CS2040 (Data Structures and Algorithms) course in Semester 1 of AY19/20. his problem involves the use of the DFS algorithm but it should only be called when an unvisited piece of land is found. When the DFS algorithm is running, clouds can be considered as land in order to minimise the number of islands.
