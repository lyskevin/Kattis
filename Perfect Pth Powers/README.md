## Personal Thoughts

Problem that I attempted during my winter break in 2019. Can be solved by calculating each number's prime factors and finding the greatest common divisor (gcd) among their respective exponents. I did not properly account for negative numbers when first attempting this problem. The idea is to find the gcd's greatest odd divisor if a given number is negative (since -1 can contribute any odd exponent to the number).
