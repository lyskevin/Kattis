## Personal Thoughts

Problem that I attempted during my winter break in 2019. Can be solved by iteratively dividing n by 2 as much as possible before reducing it by 1 to reach m. One thing to note is that it might be cheaper to continually reduce n by 1 (n - (n / 2)) times instead of dividing it by 2, depending on the values of a and b.
