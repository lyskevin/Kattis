## Personal Thoughts

Problem that I attempted while preparing to become a Teaching Assistant (TA) for NUS' CS2040 (Data Structures and Algorithms) course in Semester 1 of AY19/20. I used a custom ArrayDeque data structure which I coded while trying out the online version of UC Berkeley's CS61B. Two ArrayDeques were used to simulate the Teque and they were kept at around the same size throughout all push operations. The use of two ArrayDeques allows for all the required operations to be carried out in O(1) time.
