## Personal Thoughts

Problem that I attempted while I was a Teaching Assistant (TA) for NUS' CS2040 (Data Structures and Algorithms) course in Semester 1 of AY19/20. I used the Pythagorean theorem to calculate the equivalent radius of a square house (if it were a round house) and stored the houses and plots in sorted order. I then compared them to see how many would fit in the given plots.
