## Personal Thoughts

Problem that I attempted while preparing to become a Teaching Assistant (TA) for NUS' CS2040 (Data Structures and Algorithms) course in Semester 1 of AY19/20. I used Floyd Warshall's algorithm to solve the problem. One thing to watch out for is the negative weight cycle checks, which gave me a lot of headaches and led to many Wrong Answer (WA) verdicts.
