## Personal Thoughts

Problem that I attempted while I was a Teaching Assistant (TA) for NUS' CS2040 (Data Structures and Algorithms) course in Semester 2 of AY19/20. If k <= n / 2, then it is possible to swap any pair of adjacent characters, which is sufficient to sort the entire string. Otherwise, we can sort the string and check if the characters which cannot move remain in the same position.
