## Personal Thoughts

Problem that I attempted during my winter break in 2019. Can be solved by manipulating the given grid. Another 2D array should be used for any updates instead of directly updating the original 2D array since this could affect future comparisons between individual cells. The values in the other 2D array can be copied over into the original 2D array after every iteration.
