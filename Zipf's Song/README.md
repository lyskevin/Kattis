## Personal Thoughts

Problem that I attempted while I was a Teaching Assistant (TA) for NUS' CS2040 (Data Structures and Algorithms) course in Semester 1 of AY19/20. I had some issues with getting the correct answer and the problem was that I did not consider the positions of the songs since this is different from their relative positions in the priority queue.
