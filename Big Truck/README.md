## Personal Thoughts

Problem that I attempted while I was a Teaching Assistant (TA) for NUS' CS2040 (Data Structures and Algorithms) course in Semester 2 of AY19/20. Can be solved with Dijkstra's Single Source Shortest Paths algorithm and weighting path costs by minimum distance followed by maximum number of items.
