## Personal Thoughts

Problem that I attempted while I was a Teaching Assistant (TA) for NUS' CS2040 (Data Structures and Algorithms) course in Semester 1 of AY19/20. The largest difference in price can be found by adding cumulative interest to each individual day and then performing a linear scan through all updated prices.
