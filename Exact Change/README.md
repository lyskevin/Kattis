## Personal Thoughts

Problem that I attempted during my winter break in 2019. My first foray into the coin change dynamic programming problem (albeit a variation of it). I had a few unsuccessful attempts because I initally thought that the denominations were provided in unlimited amounts. I have also decided to leave some comments in my source code from now on since it isn't very readable when written in this way.
