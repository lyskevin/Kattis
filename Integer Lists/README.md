## Personal Thoughts

Problem that I attempted while preparing to become a Teaching Assistant (TA) for NUS' CS2040 (Data Structures and Algorithms) course in Semester 1 of AY19/20. The problem is pretty self-explanatory but I did not go with the most obvious solution, which is to actually reverse the list. Instead, I manipulated the list's index positions and used a boolean flag to keep track of whether the list is supposed to be reversed or not.
