## Personal Thoughts

Problem that I attempted while I was a Teaching Assistant (TA) for NUS' CS2040 (Data Structures and Algorithms) course in Semester 1 of AY19/20.
Calculate and store the divisors of n up to the square root of n and also add the corresponding divisors which are larger than the square root
of n.
