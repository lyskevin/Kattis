## Personal thoughts

Brute force algorithm which I coded while taking NUS' CS2040 (Data Structures and Algorithms) course. The algorithm emulates sliding the grid in a given direction by manipulating the individual numbers. The slide left operation is fully implemented while the other three change the orientation of the grid and make use of the slide left operation before re-orienting the grid.
