## Personal Thoughts

Problem that I attempted while preparing to become a Teaching Assistant (TA) for NUS' CS2040 (Data Structures and Algorithms) course in Semester 1 of AY19/20. I counted the number of connected components using the DFS algorithm. The number of roads required is then the number of connected components - 1.
