## Personal Thoughts

Problem that I attempted while I was a Teaching Assistant (TA) for NUS' CS2040 (Data Structures and Algorithms) course in Semester 2 of AY19/20. Can be solved with the Breadth First Search (BFS) algorithm. I adapted my solution for https://open.kattis.com/problems/fire2 to solve this problem.
